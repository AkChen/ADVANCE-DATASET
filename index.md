## Brief Introduction

The audiovisual aerial scene recognition task has not been explored before. Salem et al.[1] established a dataset to explore the correlation between geotagged sound clips and overhead images. For further facilitating the research in this field, we construct a new dataset, with high-quality images and scene labels, named as Aerial sceNe reCognition datasEt(ADVANCE), which in summary contains 5075 pairs of aerial images and sounds, classified into 13 classes.
